Personal Project: Created a python script to parse through discord chat channels of a stock discord server and gather all the open/closed positions for options trading. Displayed the data on the website for the members of the server to easily see the open/closed positions and all the information about the positions.

Edit: The discord for this project shut down unfortunately, still a fun personal project where I learned quite a bit.
