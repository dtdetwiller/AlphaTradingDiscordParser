$NNOX IDEA @Stocks @Options 
- roll calls into shares (100 shares, 9.6% portfolio allocation)
- hedge with 12/18 $30 puts (2.6% allocation)
- Still unsure of how I want to play this but this is one idea, standing by original thesis that the demo will be fantastic and we could very well see $$$ digits, will decide by 12/2 as the demo is 12/3

Missed your call for DIS where did you   Post it?


[11-Dec-20 12:19 PM] Anthony4#3192
In #day-trader-territory‚ò† , I post the numbers to look out for calls and or puts if said, it‚Äôs hard to signal exact positions so I try to just give the numbers where I am looking to buy, I can start signaling exact positions but my fill could be higher or lower from where I signaled, if that would work better @rtlife

Trying to come up with a plan for $TLRY position @Options


[15-Dec-20 08:19 PM] Anthony4#3192
Here some thoughts
- I really think we should be green on position but if we are still down a little, I will be holding as once the merger is confirmed that will push us up even more
- if we break $10 and hold above no reason we can‚Äôt get to $12+
- $TLRY was at $17-20 PM when Biden was announced president... don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt test those levels 

Here‚Äôs just some thoughts and I will post a chart with this @Options

So of those plays for stimulus, other than riot and Mara you think it‚Äôs still a valid entry right Joan


[17-Dec-20 09:28 AM] brickman560#6595
Now


[17-Dec-20 09:29 AM] Anthony4#3192
$SLV is up a bit but I think we‚Äôre just getting started and all the others are fair entries @brickman560


[17-Dec-20 09:29 AM] Anthony4#3192
$ostk is long gone too


[17-Dec-20 09:30 AM] brickman560#6595
Long gone as in too late?


[17-Dec-20 09:30 AM] brickman560#6595
Or did you mean long one


[17-Dec-20 09:30 AM] Anthony4#3192
I‚Äôd say long gone , I do think it‚Äôll hit 100+ by March so obviously a lot of upside but it is up a lot from where I paid


[17-Dec-20 09:31 AM] brickman560#6595
Got it


[17-Dec-20 09:31 AM] brickman560#6595
So $gold and $ma are the only ones that haven‚Äôt gone up too far yet?


[17-Dec-20 09:32 AM] Anthony4#3192
Correct $MA is up 10% atm


[17-Dec-20 09:32 AM] Anthony4#3192
Should be great if stimulus is true


[17-Dec-20 09:32 AM] brickman560#6595

Do you mind explaining why you like $gold and $ma


[17-Dec-20 09:36 AM] brickman560#6595
For stimulus


[17-Dec-20 09:38 AM] Anthony4#3192
$GOLD for stimulus is since money is being injected to economy, commodities go up because people flood to them as they are inflation hedges, for $MA, it went up significantly last stimulus as people are spending money so they expect more transactions and business

What are the costs on both?


[29-Dec-20 09:28 AM] Anthony4#3192
.38 for $MA, .18 for $SPY
- LOGIC BEHIND IT
- $MA will have a massive gap up if the $2000 check is passed 
-$SPY would tank hard because Republicans imo would lose the senate and we could have a blue wave, that‚Äôs just my opinion and how I feel
