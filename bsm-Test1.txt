Watching $TTCF here - my average cost is right around 15, don't want to dip in the red so I have put in a stop loss in case we keep dropping (tho it does seem to want to hold around 15.50)

Current $TTCF is long shares about 8% of portfolio. Like I said if it dips below 15 I will likely be selling and will restructure with calls for sometime in 2021

So far, you can expect around 38% compound annual growth rate on your total portfolio, or 89% compound annual growth rate on the actual amount of capital used. The prophet currently has a 10% edge on the market in generated alpha. Putting the alpha in Alpha Trading Group 🦁 💪 .

@BlackSmokeMonster quick question can you trade options with BTO?


[08-Dec-20 01:57 PM] BlackSmokeMonster#0917
bto just means "Buy to Open" which is the technical name for the trade order when buying an option contract.

- I think there's a good chance this Tesla rally will peak the day before S&P 500 inclusion. 
- Reward over Risk here is 3:1
- Max loss = $250 per spread if Tesla is below 690 by 12/18 close
- Max Reward = $750 per spread is Tesla is above 700 by 12/18 close
