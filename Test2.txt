$NNOX IDEA @Stocks @Options 
- roll calls into shares (100 shares, 9.6% portfolio allocation)
- hedge with 12/18 $30 puts (2.6% allocation)
- Still unsure of how I want to play this but this is one idea, standing by original thesis that the demo will be fantastic and we could very well see $$$ digits, will decide by 12/2 as the demo is 12/3

Missed your call for DIS where did you   Post it?


[11-Dec-20 12:19 PM] Anthony4#3192
In #day-trader-territory‚ò† , I post the numbers to look out for calls and or puts if said, it‚Äôs hard to signal exact positions so I try to just give the numbers where I am looking to buy, I can start signaling exact positions but my fill could be higher or lower from where I signaled, if that would work better @rtlife

-  hyre is breakout stock for 2021
- dbx is undervalued stock and buyout imminent 
- ipob : merger coming up this week, compare it to Zillow by market cap and you‚Äôll see why it‚Äôs undervalued here
- pton: running this stock to the ground ($30) one of the most overvalued stocks besides zoom
- baba : beautiful dip from news this week, had to take advantage

Trying to come up with a plan for $TLRY position @Options


[15-Dec-20 08:19 PM] Anthony4#3192
Here some thoughts
- I really think we should be green on position but if we are still down a little, I will be holding as once the merger is confirmed that will push us up even more
- if we break $10 and hold above no reason we can‚Äôt get to $12+
- $TLRY was at $17-20 PM when Biden was announced president... don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt test those levels 

Here‚Äôs just some thoughts and I will post a chart with this @Options

[17-Dec-20 09:28 AM] brickman560#6595
So of those plays for stimulus, other than riot and Mara you think it‚Äôs still a valid entry right Joan


[17-Dec-20 09:28 AM] brickman560#6595
Now


[17-Dec-20 09:29 AM] Anthony4#3192
$SLV is up a bit but I think we‚Äôre just getting started and all the others are fair entries @brickman560


[17-Dec-20 09:29 AM] Anthony4#3192
$ostk is long gone too


[17-Dec-20 09:30 AM] brickman560#6595
Long gone as in too late?


[17-Dec-20 09:30 AM] brickman560#6595
Or did you mean long one


[17-Dec-20 09:30 AM] Anthony4#3192
I‚Äôd say long gone , I do think it‚Äôll hit 100+ by March so obviously a lot of upside but it is up a lot from where I paid


[17-Dec-20 09:31 AM] brickman560#6595
Got it


[17-Dec-20 09:31 AM] brickman560#6595
So $gold and $ma are the only ones that haven‚Äôt gone up too far yet?


[17-Dec-20 09:32 AM] Anthony4#3192
Correct $MA is up 10% atm


[17-Dec-20 09:32 AM] Anthony4#3192
Should be great if stimulus is true


[17-Dec-20 09:32 AM] brickman560#6595

Do you mind explaining why you like $gold and $ma


[17-Dec-20 09:36 AM] brickman560#6595
For stimulus


[17-Dec-20 09:38 AM] Anthony4#3192
$GOLD for stimulus is since money is being injected to economy, commodities go up because people flood to them as they are inflation hedges, for $MA, it went up significantly last stimulus as people are spending money so they expect more transactions and business

Did you sell tilray calls already or are you just gonna hold till it goes to zero in case it jumps up for some reason


[22-Dec-20 08:06 AM] Anthony4#3192

[22-Dec-20 08:27 AM] jwrbacon1#2444
i too missed the TLRY exit, what should we do, its down 85%


[22-Dec-20 08:27 AM] Anthony4#3192
Down 85%, it‚Äôs either up to you to see if some weed news hits and play news to see if you get a pop or just take the equity out


[22-Dec-20 08:54 AM] brickman560#6595
